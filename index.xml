Its main goal is to combine many existing OSS projects to offer an easy-to-use platform for software defined infrastructure. This includes :
Compute Virtualization using KubeVirt Software Defined Block Storage using Longhorn Software Defined Networking using Multus Snapshotting and Templates using MinIO The objective of Harvester is to use the same platform for both containerized workloads as well as more traditional VM-based workloads, and still make the latter able to use Kubernetes features like load balancing, service discovery, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
